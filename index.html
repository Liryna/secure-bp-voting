    <h1>Secure EOS Block Producer Voting</h1>
    <h2>Rationale</h2>

    <p>It is in the best interest of the entire EOS community to select block producers (a.k.a witnesses) sooner rather than later. The network will not be fully activated until at least 15% of tokens will have voted. And without fully activated network, no transfers or smart-contracts will be possible. At the same time we expect that many bad actors will try to exploit inexperienced users by providing fake voting tools aimed to steal their private keys and then access their EOS tokens.</p>

    <h2>Why off-line?</h2>

    <p>Having the above situation in mind, <a href='https://tokenika.io/' target="_blank">Tokenika</a> has decided to release a tool offering the possibility of <strong>OFF-LINE</strong> voting for block producers. Contrary to the on-line equivalent, with off-line voting, if done properly, at no point in time is your EOS private key exposed to the outside world. Thus the risk of being hacked is substantially reduced.</p>

    <h2>Three steps</h2>

    <p>The process of off-line voting is divided into three simple steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>ON-LINE: <a href='https://tokenika.github.io/secure-bp-voting/1_get_blockchain_data.html' target="_blank">Fetch information about the network</a></li>
        <li><strong>OFF-LINE</strong>: <a href='https://tokenika.github.io/secure-bp-voting/2_generate_transaction.html' target="_blank">Generate and sign transaction with your private key</a></li>
        <li>ON-LINE: <a href='https://tokenika.github.io/secure-bp-voting/3_push_transaction.html' target="_blank">Push the transaction to the network</a></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Step 2 is to be done <strong>OFF-LINE</strong>, ideally on a computer which has never been connected to the Internet.</p>
