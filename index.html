    <h1>Secure EOS Block Producers Voting</h1>

    <h3>Single Page Voting</h3>

    <p>Much simpler way to vote, but if your computer was infected by some virus/keylogger in the past, this way cannot guarantee full security.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><a href="1_vote.html">Simple voting for block producers</a></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>More secure voting, without a need to use your private key on device being online</h3>

    <p>This way is more complicated, but it gives you maximum security. The process is divided into 3 steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><a href="1_get_blockchain_data.html">Fetching information about the network</a></li>
        <li><a href="2_generate_transaction.html">Generating and signing transaction with your private key</a> (you can do this offline, for example with a computer which was never connected to the internet)</li>
        <li><a href="3_push_transaction.html">Pushing transaction to the network</a></li>
    </ol>
